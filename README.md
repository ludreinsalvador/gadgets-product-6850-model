## Objective and Scope

- Objective:
  - To create a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will purchase Product 6850 in January 2019 with an accuracy above 85% and a recall of at least 70%.

- Hypothesis:
  - Customer Demographics Impact Buying Behavior - Customers of a certain age group, gender, or membership type are more likely to buy Product 6850.
  - Past Purchase History Predicts Future Purchases - Customers who have purchased gadgets or similar product categories in the past 3 months are more likely to buy Product 6850.
  - Weather Conditions Affect Purchase Decisions - Sales of Product 6850 are higher on cloudy/rainy days and lower on sunny days.
  - Frequent Shoppers are More Likely to Buy - Customers with higher overall spending and transaction frequency have a higher chance of buying Product 6850.
