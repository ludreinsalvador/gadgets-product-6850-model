---

## Overview
This project aims to predict customer purchases to increase sales revenue of a low-performing product.

---

## Data Used
- **[week8_student_project.csv.gz](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mEZBg2X8ZA33ulqEApWkZxXSH2FA_BkU/view?usp=drive_link)** - This is the dataset used for building the ML model.

---

## Objective and Scope

- **Objective**:
  - To create a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will purchase Product 6850 in January 2019 with an accuracy above 85% and a recall of at least 70%.

- **Hypothesis**:
  - Customer Demographics Impact Buying Behavior - Customers of a certain age group, gender, or membership type are more likely to buy Product 6850.
  - Past Purchase History Predicts Future Purchases - Customers who have purchased gadgets or similar product categories in the past 3 months are more likely to buy Product 6850.
  - Weather Conditions Affect Purchase Decisions - Sales of Product 6850 are higher on cloudy/rainy days and lower on sunny days.
  - Frequent Shoppers are More Likely to Buy - Customers with higher overall spending and transaction frequency have a higher chance of buying Product 6850.

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations

Below are some key exploratory data analysis visuals that helped understand buyer behavior and feature relationships:

![Age Distribution](visualization/age-buyers-vs-nonbuyers.png)
- **Age Distribution of Buyers vs Non-Buyers**
  - Specific age groups dominate purchases.
  - Older demographics (45â€“60 years) buy more gadgets.
  - This would help refine marketing strategies.

![Transaction Amount](visualization/txn-amt-buyers-vs-nonbuyers.png)
- **Transaction Amount Comparison**
  - Buyers spend consistent amounts, indicating budget preference.
  - Non-buyers have higher variance in spending.
  - This helps in customer segmentation for targeted promotions.

![Gender Distribution](visualization/gender-buyers-vs-nonbuyers.png)
- **Gender Comparison**
  - Female buyers slightly outnumber male buyers for Product 6850.
  - Gender-based targeting may improve marketing effectiveness.
  - This supports personalized recommendation strategies.

![Weather Impact](visualization/weather-impact.png)
- **Impact of Weather on Buying Behavior**
  - Trend: Cloudy/rainy days boost gadget sales.
  - Hypothesis Validated: Weather affects consumer decisions.
  - Seasonal promotions could improve sales.

![Confusion Matrix](visualization/confusion-matrix.png)
- **Model Performance Confusion Matrix**
  - Low false negatives, high true positives.
  - Outcome: Model performs well in identifying potential buyers.
